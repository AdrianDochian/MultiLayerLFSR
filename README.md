## Introduction

<a name="introduction"></a>

Linear feedback shift register(**LFSR**) is a digital circuit composed of linked registers .
<br>
Shifting the LFSR left/right with one bit and replacing the lost bit in a deterministic 
manner with respect to some bits of the previous state creates this mechanism of pseudo 
random bit generation.

<br>
In this example the new bit value is the result of the XOR operation between the value
of the first register and the third.

The **initial state** of the LFSR and the **registers who contribute** at computing the next bit
are **the seed** of the generator.

<br>
The LFSR state will at some point repeat duo to its linear nature thus the sequence generated by it
will repeat.
<br>

Choosing **the seed** seed is an important part of construction an LFSR. It dictates **the length
of the non-repeating sequence** and **sequence randomness degree**.

Linear feedback shift registers are good pseudo random bit generators due to the next reasons:
1) Long non-repeating sequences close to 2^n for an LFSR constructed of N registers.
2) Good bit randomness.
